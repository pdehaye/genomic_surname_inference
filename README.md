**How much does your genome say about you?**

If you are male, your Y chromosome together with genealogical databases pretty much gives out your last name. This is an attempt at implementing the original attack of Gymrek et al. (or rather reuse the output of their software lobSTR). 

*WARNING WARNING WARNING*

This is an effort to teach myself some computational biology and associated data wrangling. I am neither a biologist nor a computational biologist. I know some of the markers are off, and have not gone through the complete validation tests described in the original paper. Any comment/correction/suggestion welcomed.

File `internet_archive_www_smgf_org_slash_ychromosome_slash_marker_standards.jspx` 
is an Internet Archive scrape of old website listing correspondance between genealogical and NIST Y-STR markers, located [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20130518082814/http://www.smgf.org/ychromosome/marker_standards.jspx)


`Science_Gymrek_et_al/` contains Science original paper and supplementary material


`lobSTR_ystr_hg19.bed` is  a .bed reference file for Y-STRs


`1000genomes_20130606_g1k.ped` and `1000genomes_20130606_g1k_CEU.ped` are pedigree files for 1000 genomes participants
